# DIAR

Can reduced seeds lead to more effective fuzzing? We build a new coverage-based reducer called DIAR to explore this. 

Reduce a test seed, for an application binary, using `diar.py`. Then you may investigate how a fuzzer like AFL performs with the reduced seed. 

Our investigation was accepted in [the 5th International Workshop on the Next Level of Test Automation (NEXTA '22)](https://icst2022.vrain.upv.es/home/nexta-2022).
